"""
This module contains tests for :module:`bet.caculcateP.calculateP`.

    * compare using same lambda_emulated (iid and regular grid)
    * compare using different lambda_emulated

Most of these tests should make sure certain values are within a tolerance
rather than exact due to the stocastic nature of the algorithms being tested.
